# physics-based-circle-packing
Exploration of circle packing using a physics simulation of repelling particles. (For the loosest definition of all of those words). 


I will be implementing the algorithm in a few languages.

^^^^^ That blog post is the initial inspiration for this project <3 

Also using knowledge previously learned from [Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com) including [Challenge 50: Circle Packing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHEQuoIKgNE&t=4s)
